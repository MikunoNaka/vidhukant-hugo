# vidhukant-hugo

Vidhu Kant's (mine) Hugo theme. See this live on [vidhukant.xyz.](https://vidhukant.xyz)

If you like my theme and want to use it, I recommend forking this repository as I may drastically change the theme if I wanted to.
I appreciate people liking this theme and wanting to use it, but this is more or less a personal theme so I probably won't look at any suggestions, sorry.
